  <h1>Tweaker Porn - Party and Play Hub</h1>
  <br><br>
  <h2>PNP Porn Sites for the Party and Play Community, whether Gay Straight or Bi <a href="https://www.pnptube.com">Gay PNP Tube</a>
 or <a href="https://smokehou.se">Straight</h2>
 <br><br>
 <b>PNP Tube - Gay Party and Play Hub</b>
 <br>
 <p>PNP Tube is the first and largest completely *free porn tube site* designed from it's inception to cater specifically to
 the massive underground Gay PNP community -a subculture which had traditionally been chased off of platforms citing some 
 sort of "moral high ground" sort of reasoning. This is a judgement free site where you can find all the content you crave
 in one convenient location without having to waste hours jumping from site in order to get it in piecemeal. 
<br<
Users can also upload their own videos blowing clouds, slamming, smoking, you name it without fear of being banned, censored,
 or otherwise discouraged or shamed.</p>
 <br>
 <b>Smokehou.se - the *Straight* version of PNP Tube</b>
 <br>
 <p>Following the landside success of PNP Tube, there came a flood of requests from my heterosexual party people wanting the same
 sort of site, but for their tribe. After a while, and innumerable appeals to me via twitter, NewTumbl, BDSMLR, Contact form
 and email, I simply could no longer stagnate in my laziness and allow that to continue. and thus - Smokehou.se was born - and
 thus far it has been an enormous success.
